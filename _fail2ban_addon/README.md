************************************************
- Tested On: Fail2Ban 0.9.3 > 0.10.2
- Server: Ubuntu 16.04.2 / Ubuntu 18.04.2
- Firewall: IPTables
************************************************

## Dependancies: 

- requires nginxrepeatoffender.conf in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d folder
- requires nginxrepeatoffender.conf in /etc/fail2ban/action.d folder
- requires jail settings called [nginxrepeatoffender]
- requires nginx.repeatoffender file in /etc/fail2ban

Create With:

`sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender`

`chmod +x /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender`

************************************************
## Drawbacks: 

Only works with IPTables

************************************************
:exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:
## Important Configuration Notes:

**You MUST have your file paths and default status for "enabled" declared by means of the recommended include in your [INCLUDES] section of your jail.conf or jail.local otherwise fail2ban will fail reloading when it cannot find the location `apache_access_log` or `nginx_access_log` you can also hard code log locations in your jail settings but this NOT a recommended or good practice. Your jail.local or jail.conf should have the includes as below.**

```
[INCLUDES]
before = paths-common.conf
enabled = false
```
or
```
[INCLUDES]
before = paths-debian.conf
enabled = false
```

**Please Note:**

Above we have the recommended default of "enabled = false" this is recommended good practice. 
It disables all jails until you enable each one manually. 

**To DEBUG Fail2Ban when it will not reload PLEASE follow the following commands in this exact order. Then post your error messages in a NEW ISSUE. ONLY post the last 3-4 lines where the error starts NOT the whole log message.**

`sudo service fail2ban stop`

`sudo fail2ban-client -vvv -x stop`

`sudo fail2ban-client -vvv -x start`

The 3rd step runs fail2ban in verbose client mode and will point you to the exact location where Fail2Ban stopped loading. Once you have this error message copy ONLY the last 3-4 lines and post them in a new ISSUE although if you read the message you shold quickly understand why you broke Fail2Ban and why it is not loading.

Once you have the error message or have fixed your error you just restart Fail2Ban as follows:

`sudo service fail2ban restart`

************************************************
## DOES NOT WORK - MY FAIL2BAN WON'T RESTART???

**Yes it does work**, if you followed the instructions that is. It works and has been tested on almost every version of Fail2Ban.
The most IMPORTANT steps of DEBUGGING Fail2Ban and why it fails reloading are posted just above this message. 
For your convenience I will post them again as they are extremely important steps for debugging Fail2Ban not only for this jail but any jail.

`sudo service fail2ban stop`

`sudo fail2ban-client -vvv -x stop`

`sudo fail2ban-client -vvv -x start`

************************************************
## Based on: 

The Recidive Jail from Fail2Ban

This custom filter and action for Fail2Ban will monitor your Nginx logs and perma-ban
any IP address that has generated far too many 444 or 403 errors over a 1 week period
and ban them for 1 day. This works like a charm as an add-on for my Nginx Bad
Bot Blocker which takes care of generating the 444 or 403 errors based on the extensive
list of Bad Referers, Bots, Scrapers and IP addresses that it covers. This provides short
block periods of one day which is enough to keep agressive bots from filling up your log files.
See - https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker for more info on the Nginx Bad Bot Blocker

This custom action requires a custom jail in your jail.local file for Fail2Ban

Your jail file would be configured as follows

```
[nginxrepeatoffender]
enabled = true
logpath = %(nginx_access_log)s
filter = nginxrepeatoffender
banaction = nginxrepeatoffender
bantime  = 86400   ; 1 day
findtime = 604800   ; 1 week
maxretry = 20
```

************************************************
# Blocking wp-login.php attacks on Wordpress Sites

See the included /filter.d/nginx-limit-req.conf jail and filter for detecting and blocking wp-login attacks
The original /filter.d/nginx-limit-req.conf file from Fail2Ban is included including a /filter.d/nginx-limit-req.local file with the settings you need to detect and block wp-logins.
An example of the jail settings for your jail.local file is included in the jail.local sample.
This works great at picking up wp-login attacks.
Be sure to add the rate limiting zone to your nginx.conf as per instructions in /filter.d/nginx-limit-req.local
